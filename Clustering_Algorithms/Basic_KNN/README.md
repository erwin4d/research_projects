# K nearest neighbors

This folder contains generic K nearest neighbors code, which computes K nearest neighbors for training / testing datasets. Code computes lp distances. Most of this code is inspired by BTRY 6520 (Computationally Intensive Statistical Methods) when it was taught in Fall 2012.

The matlab code in this folder is relatively unoptimized.
